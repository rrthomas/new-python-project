This is a simple program which you can use to create a new Python project
from a built-in template. It uses the
[Nancy](https://github.com/rrthomas/nancy/) templating system.


## Installation

```
pip install new-python-project
```


## Creating a new project

Run `new-python-project DIRECTORY`. The program will prompt you for basic information about the project, attempting to give sensible default values, and then create the project in the given directory.

You can run your new program:

```
cd /path/to/new-project
make build
PYTHONPATH=. python -m project_name
```

The project is set up in a new git repository with a `pyproject.toml` and
Makefile to build, test and publish it, and basic command-line handling.
